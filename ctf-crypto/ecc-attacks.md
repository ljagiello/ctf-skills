## Small Subgroup Attacks

- Check curve order for small factors
- Pohlig-Hellman: solve DLP in small subgroups, combine with CRT

```python
# SageMath ECC basics
E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
G = E.gens()[0]  # generator
order = E.order()
```

---

## Invalid Curve Attacks

If point validation is missing, send points on weaker curves. Craft points with small-order subgroups to leak secret key bits.

---

## Singular Curves

If discriminant delta = 0, curve is singular. DLP becomes easy (maps to additive/multiplicative group).

---

## Smart's Attack (Anomalous Curves)

**When to use:** Curve order equals field characteristic p (anomalous curve). Solves ECDLP in O(1) via p-adic lifting.

**Detection:** `E.order() == p` — always check this first!

**SageMath (automatic):**
```python
E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
G = E(Gx, Gy)
Q = E(Qx, Qy)
# Sage's discrete_log handles anomalous curves automatically
secret = G.discrete_log(Q)
```

**Manual p-adic lift (when Sage's auto method fails):**
```python
def smart_attack(p, a, b, G, Q):
    E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [a, b])
    Qp = pAdicField(p, 2)  # p-adic field with precision 2
    Ep = EllipticCurve(Qp, [a, b])

    # Lift points to p-adics
    Gp = Ep.lift_x(ZZ(G[0]), all=True)  # try both lifts
    Qp_point = Ep.lift_x(ZZ(Q[0]), all=True)

    for gp in Gp:
        for qp in Qp_point:
            try:
                # Multiply by p to get points in kernel of reduction
                pG = p * gp
                pQ = p * qp
                # Extract p-adic logarithm
                x_G = ZZ(pG[0] / pG[1]) / p  # or pG.xy()
                x_Q = ZZ(pQ[0] / pQ[1]) / p
                secret = ZZ(x_Q / x_G) % p
                if E(G) * secret == E(Q):
                    return secret
            except (ZeroDivisionError, ValueError):
                continue
    return None
```

**Multi-layer decryption after key recovery:** Challenge may wrap flag in AES-CBC + DES-CBC or similar — just busywork once the ECC key is recovered. Derive keys with SHA-256 of shared secret.

---

## ECC Fault Injection

**Pattern (Faulty Curves):** Bit flip during ECC computation reveals private key bits.

**Attack:** Compare correct vs faulty ciphertext, recover key bit-by-bit:
```python
# For each key bit position:
# If fault at bit i changes output -> key bit i affects computation
# Binary distinguisher: faulty_output == correct_output -> bit is 0
```

---

## Clock Group DLP via Pohlig-Hellman (LACTF 2026)

**Pattern (the-clock):** Diffie-Hellman on unit circle group: x^2 + y^2 = 1 (mod p).

**Key facts:**
- Group law: (x1,y1) * (x2,y2) = (x1*y2 + y1*x2, y1*y2 - x1*x2)
- **Group order = p + 1** (not p - 1!)
- Isomorphic to GF(p^2)* elements of norm 1

**Group operations:**
```python
def clock_mul(P, Q, p):
    x1, y1 = P
    x2, y2 = Q
    return ((x1*y2 + y1*x2) % p, (y1*y2 - x1*x2) % p)

def clock_pow(P, n, p):
    result = (0, 1)  # identity
    base = P
    while n > 0:
        if n & 1:
            result = clock_mul(result, base, p)
        base = clock_mul(base, base, p)
        n >>= 1
    return result
```

**Recovering hidden prime p:**
```python
# Given points on the curve, p divides (x^2 + y^2 - 1)
from math import gcd
vals = [x**2 + y**2 - 1 for x, y in known_points]
p = reduce(gcd, vals)
# May need to remove small factors
```

**Attack when p+1 is smooth:**
```python
# 1. Recover p from points: gcd(x^2 + y^2 - 1) across known points
# 2. Factor p+1 into small primes
# 3. Pohlig-Hellman: solve DLP in each small subgroup, CRT combine
# 4. Compute shared secret, derive AES key (e.g., via MD5)
```

**Identification:** Challenge mentions "clock", "circle", or gives points satisfying x^2+y^2=1. Always check if p+1 (not p-1) is smooth.
